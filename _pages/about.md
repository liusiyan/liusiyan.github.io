I am a current [Ph.D. student](https://barati.ku.edu/siyan-liu) major in [Chemical & Petroleum Engineering at the University of Kansas](https://cpe.ku.edu/), and working in [Dr.Barati's research group](https://cpe.ku.edu/reza-barati) while co-advising by [Dr. Chi Zhang](http://www.chizhanggeophysics.com) in Department of Geology, my current research focuses on pore-scale modeling and reactive transport core flood simulations, specifically, modeling the Low-salinity waterflooding enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in carbonates rock sample at pore scale, which includes multiphase fluid flow in porous media coupled with geochemical reactions. The final model would be the model integration of single/multi-phase flow in porous media, diffusion, eletrodynamics and reactions, which will be used in evaluate the internal mechanism of Low-salinity waterflood and other complex processes within petroleum and geophysics research area. 

Before Ph.D. study, I obtained my Master's degree in Petroleum Engineering in same department at December 2017, with thesis entitled ["Prediction of Capillary Pressure and Relative Permeability Curves using Conventional Pore-scale Displacements and Artificial Neural Networks"](https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/26357), which is mainly about the integration of the artificial neural networks and pore scale modeling.

I received another M.S. in geology and paleontology and B.S. in Geology and resource exploration engineering in Chang'an University before my studies at the University of Kansas.
