C&PE 325 An introduction to numerical methods and statistics and their application to engineering problems. 
Numerical methods topics include finding roots of a single nonlinear equation, numerical solution of ordinary differential equations, 
numerical integration, and solutions of ordinary differential equations. Statistical topics include regression and curve fitting, 
probability and probability distributions, expected value and hypothesis testing, and optimization of single and multiple-variable systems. 
Implementing numerical algorithms using computer programming will be emphasized, along with the fundamentals of programming, including data typing, branching, 
and iteration. Applications specific to chemical and petroleum engineering systems will be considered. 
The fast, easy to use dynamical typed programming language [Julia](https://julialang.org/) (https://julialang.org/) will be introduced in this course.
