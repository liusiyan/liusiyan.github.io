## Abstract
Three-dimensional numerical earth models play an increasingly central role in the modern engineering and petroleum industry. They are routinely used to plan new wells, calculate hydrocarbon reserves and help to predict production profile. In the reservoir modeling subject there are different methods for 3D-reservoir modeling. In our present study the geostatistical method is used for 3D-modeling of the siliciclastic reservoir in the An-Sai Oil Field, Shaanxi, Central China. Combined with regional geological background, we made a 3D-reservoir model based on logging facies, lithofacies and other data analysis in Chang2 oil reservoir, then identifid three major kinds of sedimentary microfacies, interchannel bar, washland and river depression. To analysis the reservoir heterogeneity, the output data of the study also indicating the remaining oil distribution, while according to results of modeling analysis gives favorable region prediction and residual oil development potential. based on this put forward further development adjustment recommendations on this oilfield.
